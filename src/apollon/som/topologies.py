    Compute the Von Neuman Neighbourhood of index (x, y) given an array with
    dimension (dx, dy). The Von Neumann Neighbourhood is the 4-neighbourhood,
    which includes the four direct neighbours of index (x, y) given a rect-
    angular array.

    Params:
        x    (int)       x-Index for which to compute the neighbourhood.
        y    (int)       y-Index for which to compute the neighbourhood.
        dx   (int)       Size of enclosing array's x-axis.
        dy   (int)       Size of enclosing array's y-axis.
        flat (bool)      Return flat index if True. Default is False.

    Return:
        1d-array of ints if flat, 2d-array otherwise.
